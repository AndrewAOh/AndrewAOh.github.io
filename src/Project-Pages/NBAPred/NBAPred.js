                    <p> In this project, I developed machine learning models to predict point totals in NBA games, aiming to outperform Vegas over/under lines and achieve an accuracy exceeding the break-even threshold of 53%. The dataset was constructed by web scraping team statistics from NBA.com and game results from ESPN.com, focusing on post-COVID NBA games from the 2020-21 to 2023-24 seasons. By using overall team statistics, I ensured the predictions remained robust and applicable over time.</p>
                    <span>Two models were created for this purpose:</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>XGBoost Regressor </b>- Designed to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) between predicted and actual total points scored.</li>
                        <li><b>XGBoost Classifier </b>- Built to classify games based on whether the total points would exceed or fall below the Vegas line.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The model's performance was evaluated on the 2024-2025 NBA season data. As of December 21, 2024 the regression model achieved an accuracy of 56.76%, surpassing the break-even mark. The model's performance, theoretically, translates to a 1.08x return on investment (ROI) using a flat betting approach. Additionally, employing the Kelly Criterion formula could increase the ROI to 1.20x, making it a valuable tool for predicting game outcomes and betting strategies.</p>
